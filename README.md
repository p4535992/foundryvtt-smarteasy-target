# Smart-Easy-Target

# THIS IS NOT A OPERATIONAL MODULE

# I'm just learning how to write code for Foundry VTT.

## Features

1. Target with Alt+Click
2. For players, target by just left clicking a non-owned token
3. Show portraits instead of colored pips to indicate targets, positioning\offset and size of the icons can be configured in the module settings
4. Customize color\shape of the targeting reticule

## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:
1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-smarteasy-target/main/module.json`
4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button

### libWrapper

This module uses the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.
